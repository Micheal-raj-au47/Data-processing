# Data-processing
Here we have done a project on how to align the values in column level using regex 
How to align the values if your data set completely messed up. this case most probeably happens when you download data set from workflow management tools
Steps:
      1)Create dataframe for all the columns and use regexp to find values with respect to column
      2)append all the values based on index level so that values don't get placed in wrong rows
      3)merge all the dataframe in to single dataframe
      4)change dataframe in to csv file
